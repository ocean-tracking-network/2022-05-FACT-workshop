OTN has hosted other workshops in the past which contain different code sets that may be useful to explore after this workshop. There are also lessons regarding telemetry reporting and background information on Nodes


### R Coding Workshops

- [MigraMar workshop 2022](https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/migramar-student-workshop-2022/index.html)
    This workshop will introduce learners to the concept of the MigraMar Database Node, including instructions for data submission and metadata template completion. Then, we will explore the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging.

- [FACT workshop 2021](https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/2021-12-15-fact-workshop/)
    This pair of workshops will introduce the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging.
    In the “introductory” session we will explore some of the popular software packages suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data, including dplyr and ggplot2, for the purpose of generating summaries for reports.
    The second “advanced” session offers a brief overview of the glatos R package for performing detection filtering, various calculations and plotting. The data is then transformed for ingestion into the powerful acoustic telemetry packages VTrack.

- [GLATOS workshop 2021](https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/2021-03-30-glatos-workshop/index.html)
    In addition to the introduction to R, glatos and VTrack ingestion, this workshop includes an introduction to `actel` and how to get your records into that package.

- [FACT workshop 2020](https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/2020-12-17-telemetry-packages-FACT/index.html)
    In addition to the introduction to R, glatos and VTrack ingestion, this workshop includes content from guest speakers Dr. Hugo Flavio who will introduce actel in more detail, and Dr. Charles Bangley who will introduce the learners to boosted regression trees and gbm.auto.

- [SPG workshop 2020](https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/2020-07-16-OTNSPG-R-workshop/index.html). [Videos available on our YouTube here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_06zLsCWuDTeUyd5p2YWrullO5RmKLDA) 
    This one-day workshop will introduce the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging, exploring some of the popular software packages suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data, including dplyr and ggplot. Some specific attention will be paid to the spatial nature of telemetry datasets and a brief introduction to a newer package, spdplyr, that carries the dplyr workflow into spatial data objects. The second session offers a brief overview of the glatos R package for performing some of these same tasks using standard functions. In the final session, we will have guest speakers leading a series of discussions on choosing an appropriate analysis for your telemetry data, and applying the knowledge gained from your studies to decision makers and to enhance public knowledge.

- [DFO workshop 2020](https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/2020-03-11-DFOBIO-telemetry-workshop/)
    This one-day workshop begins with an overview of OTN and its role in aggregating telemetry data, an introduction to taking your records from fieldnotes to analysis ready data sets, and where when and how to submit data and metadata to OTN. In the second session, you will be introduced to exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data in R using dplyr and ggplot. The third session offers a brief overview of the glatos R package for performing some of these same tasks using standard functions, and in the final session, you'll get an introduction to statistical analysis of animal behavioural states using Hidden Markov models and the moveHMM R package.

- [FACT workshop 2020](https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/2020-12-17-telemetry-packages-FACT/index.html)
    This pair of workshops will introduce the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging.
    In session one we will explore some of the popular software packages suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data, including dplyr and ggplot2, for the purpose of generating summaries for reports.
    The second session offers a brief overview of the glatos R package for performing detection filtering, various calculations and plotting. The data is then transformed for ingestion into the powerful acoustic telemetry packages VTrack and actel. We will end off the second session with guest speakers Dr. Hugo Flavio who will introduce actel in more detail, and Dr. Charles Bangley who will introduce the learners to boosted regression trees and gbm.auto.

- [GLATOS meeting workshop 2020](https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/2020-02-27-glatos-workshop/index.html)
    Workshop content covered the glatos package including residency index, REI and crosswalking to vtrack.

- [GLATOS meeting intro to R 2020](https://caitlinbate.github.io/2020-02-23-glatos/index.html)
    Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems

- IdeasOTN Telemetry Workshop Series 2020: [code available here](https://github.com/kimwhoriskey/ideasOTNtws2020code) and [videos available on our YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_06zLsCWuDRnmIKaMHTBlg5KTKS76k6u)
    This series of lectures and workshops focuses on how to conduct a study with acoustic telemetry, how to effectively support and analyze the data, and appropriate methods for communicating your results and collaborating with agencies outside of academia. 

- [General telemetry workflow](https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/jb-acoustic-telemetry/index.html)
    OTN, FACT and GLATOS all provide researchers with pre-formatted data sets, which are easily ingested into the data analysis tools. Before diving into a lot of analysis, it is important to take the time to clean and sort your data set, taking the pre-formatted files and combining them in different ways, allowing you to analyse the data with different questions in mind. There are multiple R packages necessary for efficient and thorough telemetry data analysis. General packages that allow for data cleaning and arrangement, dataset manipulation and visualization, network analysis and temporo-spatial locating are used in conjuction with the telemetry analysis tool packages VTtrack, ATT and GLATOS.

Many of our Intro to R workshops are based upon this curriculum from [The Carpentries](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/).
